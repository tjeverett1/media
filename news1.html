      <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng held the meetings in Geneva.</p>
      <p>Both China and the United States have said that they've made progress at trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland.</p>
      
      <p>The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were "in‑depth" and "candid".</p>
      
      <p>The pair were engaged in secretive closed‑door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January.</p>

      <!-- Sub‑heading -->
      <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Tariffs and market reaction</h2>
      <p>The talks were the first face‑to‑face meetings between the two countries since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with a 125% levy on some US goods.</p>
      <p>The huge tariffs caused turmoil in the financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>
      <p>Full details from the talks will be jointly released on Monday.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>One trade expert told the BBC's <em>Business Today</em> programme that the announcement may include cuts to their tariffs.</p>
      <p>But Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation, was less optimistic. “The so‑called reciprocal tariffs could be addressed, but probably not. I think mostly what I expect is an agreement to keep talking,” she said on the BBC's <em>Newsday</em> programme.</p>

      <!-- Continue with more paragraphs... -->
      <p>Following the conclusion of the two‑day talks in Geneva, US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said “the deal we struck with our Chinese partners” would help reduce the US's $1.2 trn (£901 bn) trade deficit.</p>
      <p>Mr Bessent said the US and China have made “substantial progress” on de‑escalating the trade war, while Vice Premier He said the talks were “of great significance to the two countries but also have an important impact on the stability and development of the global economy”.</p>
      <p>He told reporters in Geneva that the meetings had been substantive, Reuters reported.</p>
