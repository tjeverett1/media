          <p>The cardinals electing a new pope to lead the Roman Catholic Church left the Sistine Chapel exhausted and hungry.</p>
    
          <p>A meditation to start the conclave had dragged on and pushed their first vote deep into Wednesday evening. It had resulted in an inconclusive tally, with three main contenders. Keeping their vow of secrecy, they returned to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where they were sequestered without their phones, and started talking.</p>
    
          <p>Over dinner, as one gluten‑free cardinal picked over vegetables and others shrugged at the simple fare, they weighed their choices. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, the Italian who ran the Vatican under Pope Francis, had entered the conclave as a front‑runner but hadn’t received overwhelming support during the vote. The Italians were divided, and some of the cardinals in the room had become bothered by his failure to emphasize the collaborative meetings that Francis prioritized for governing the church.</p>
    
          <p>That left Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, 69 — a quiet American dark horse — as a source of particular interest. A missionary turned religious‑order leader turned Peruvian bishop turned Vatican power player, he checked many of the boxes that a broad range of cardinals hoped to fill.</p>
    
          <blockquote class="blockquote px-3 py-2 bg-light rounded my-4">
            “You begin to see the direction and say, ‘Oh my goodness, I’m not going to use my five days’ worth of clothes,’”  
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">Cardinal Pablo Virgilio Siongco David of the Philippines</footer>
          </blockquote>
    
          <p>By the next morning, he had transformed into an unsuspecting juggernaut who ultimately left little room for rival candidacies and ideological camps.</p>
    
          <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Building Support in Secrecy</h2>
          <p>After the death of Francis on April 21, cardinals from around the world began arriving in Rome. They joined powerful players in the Vatican who ran the church’s bureaucracy, including Cardinal Prevost, whose career Francis had boosted.</p>
    
          <p>Despite his intimate understanding of the Vatican, Cardinal Prevost was still among the newbies, having been a cardinal not even two years. He turned to one of the reported front‑runners, Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle of the Philippines, for help. “How does this work?” the American said, according to Cardinal Tagle, who recounted the conversation. “I had experience in a conclave, and he didn’t.”</p>

          <p>Those more intimate settings played to Cardinal Prevost’s strengths, as he had gained a reputation around Rome as a studiously prepared, collegial collaborator. “I just admire the way he runs a meeting,” said Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago.</p>
    
          <h2 class="h4 mt-5">A Swift, Stunning Consensus</h2>
          <p>On Wednesday, after a long and solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, the cardinals gathered and took their vows. Just before 6 p.m. the doors closed. The meditation ran about an hour—so long that Cardinal Parolin asked whether they should delay the vote to the next morning. They chose to press on and, by the fourth vote, ballots overwhelmingly shifted to Cardinal Prevost.</p>
    
          <blockquote class="blockquote px-3 py-2 bg-light rounded my-4">
            “And he remained seated! Somebody had to pull him up. We were all teary‑eyed.”  
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">Cardinal Pablo Virgilio Siongco David of the Philippines</footer>
          </blockquote>
    
          <p>When the count reached the two‑thirds majority threshold of 89 votes, white smoke rose over the chapel chimney. Leo XIV emerged to greet the world from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.</p>
